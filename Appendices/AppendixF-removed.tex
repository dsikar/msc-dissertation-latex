\section{Goodness of steer results}

% REMOVED because plots were generated with an incorrect understanding of 
% what tcpflow logs actually contained.

To compare models, the $G_s$ (Eq. \ref{eq:goodness_of_steer}) was used. Figure  \ref{fig:genTrackOneLap_20201120171015_sanity_gos} contains (discuss):
\begin{itemize}
    \item[--] The PID effect
    \item[--] 
\end{itemize}
The
A second data output was created for the Generated Track circuit. (TODO, create another dataset and plot to compare PID to and manual steering angles).
A video was then created to observe steering angles while recording another dataset on the same lap \href{https://youtu.be/zAmr7a1ImEY}{https://youtu.be/zAmr7a1ImEY}. The video shows steering corrections

To confirm the observed acute steering angle variations, a second lap was recorded, producing the same plot

The values of Prop and Diff (Proportional and Derivative components of PID steering) were changed while observing steering 
% PID 25, Diff 8, max speed 1.6

This had a smoothing effect to the steering, though the $Gs$ increased:
