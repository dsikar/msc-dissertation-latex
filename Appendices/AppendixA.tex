As there were many training jobs to run, requiring storage and computing resources that could not be accommodated in a single environment without incurring extra costs, the workload was spread over different environments.

\section{Datasets}

A template directory structure was created such that downloaded data could be accessed in code with the same paths. The structure exists in the datasets repository and once cloned creates the template directory:
\begin{verbatim}
$ git clone https://github.com/dsikar/msc-data
$ tree -d msc-data/
msc-data/
 audi
 ford
 kitti
 mechanical-turk
 udacity
 unity
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Ford AV Dataset}

The steering angles can be extracted from .bag files using ROS commands:
\begin{verbatim}
    # In one terminal, start ros engine
    $ roscore
    # In another terminal, inspect content of bag file
    $ time rosbag info Sample-Data.bag
    # And subscribe to topic of interest 
    $ rostopic echo /imu | tee sample_imu.yaml
    # In another terminal, playback bag file
    $ time rosbag play --immediate Sample-Data.bag --topics /imu
    # Sanity check, count number of acquisitions
    $ cat sample_imu.yaml | grep "orientation:" | wc -l
\end{verbatim}
The snippet above generates file imu.yaml, with all pose data generated by imu device. From this file we extract the steering angle, which is the z axis (yaw) of the orientation field (TODO check .yaml dialect). 
Images files and information can be extracted with the bag\_to\_images.py script:
\begin{verbatim}
    $ python2 bag_to_images.py Sample-Data.bag ~/git/msc-data/ford/sample/ros/ \
        /image_front_left
\end{verbatim}
The image can be matched with a steering angle by obtaining the timestamp of image:


\section{Development Environments}

\subsection{Intel DevCloud}

Intel provides a 200GB storage quota. Storage use can be checked with getquota command:
\begin{verbatim}
$ getquota
199.78 GB out of 200.00 GB (99.89%) used   
\end{verbatim}
Jobs are queued with qsub command:
\begin{verbatim}
    $ qsub -l nodes=1:gpu:ppn=2 ford_sample_download.sh -l walltime=23:59:59
\end{verbatim}
where the actual commands that run e.g. downloading data, training and testing networks are scripted in a batch file e.g. ford\_sample\_download.sh, train.sh.   
The queue can be checked with watch command:
\begin{verbatim}
    $ watch -n 1 qstat
\end{verbatim}
Jobs can run for a maximum of 24 hours, any job exceeding that execution time is terminated automatically. Jobs can be deleted from queue with qdel command.
