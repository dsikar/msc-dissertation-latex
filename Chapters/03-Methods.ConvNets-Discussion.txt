We need to clarify the concept of convolution.

Many online links, including Stanford's CNN course:
https://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/
Seem to confuse convolution with dot product of a kernel and a "receptive field" when in reality, convolution and dot product are not the same operation. 
From the Stanford cs231 course:

"CONV layer will compute the output of neurons that are connected to local regions in the input, each computing a dot product between their weights and a small region they are connected to in the input volume. This may result in volume such as [32x32x12] if we decided to use 12 filters."

Ok, clarified it here:
