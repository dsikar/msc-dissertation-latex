\label{Results} 

%This chapter presents the outputs that you produced, by applying the methods that you have selected, including e.g. analysis, design, prototyping, experimental work, evaluation, etc.  
  
%How you report these results will depend on the nature of the work. It may be helpful to divide them into basic data (e.g., for a project that developed a software product, requirements specification, test data, etc.) and analysis of the data (e.g. statistical analyses, evaluation analyses, etc.). Remember that you are informing the reader of what you have produced and found and emphasising the interesting parts, so summarising at the end of each major section is useful.  
  
%It is usually very helpful for the readers to include graphics and diagrams, for instance to clarify software design or requirements, identify key trends and relationships in empirical data, etc. If you do so, be sure to refer to these figures in the text and use them as evidence to support what you are explaining or arguing; and be sure that your figures are well designed and clearly presented â€“ do not just use default settings of the software you are using in producing them.  
  
%It is essential that you identify clearly what you accomplished or produced yourself, as opposed to what existed before you started your individual project or was provided by others. For instance, some projects build new software on top of an existing code base, add new data to an existing body of data, or are executed by a student as a member of a team. It is essential to indicate what parts of the activities and results which you report are your own work. If this is left unclear, the markers are instructed not to give credit for work that they cannot attribute to you. Ambiguity would attract penalties for poor academic practice, with delays caused by any investigation (deception would be treated as academic misconduct, of course, which may lead to expulsion).

% Feedback from Artur Garcez with respect to Results
% The most important thing now is to describe clearly (with the right level of detail - not too much, not too little) the (...) evaluation of results (there's a more objective evaluation here of accuracy/speed but also a subjective evaluation that you can discuss in more detail: when a situation changes from "no rain" to "rain" and how that affects the pre-trained network). With those results you will have the material needed for the important discussion chapter which should include your own critical evaluation of results and also point to future work.

\section{Producing a self-driving model}
TODO describe how SDSandbox did not work out of the box - author mentions in video "several hours of data are required" and model to nearly 24 hours to train on GPU. In practice, one augmentation and pre-processing were added, working models were produced in as little as 5 epochs of training, taking under 1m30s.
That was hard. Detail the bits that were used from TawnNet (augmentation added) and NaokiNet (crop changed). in the end two outputs were required for NaokiNet to work. Maybe move this to discussion. Here we show results.

% EVALUATION OF SELF-DRIVING CARS USING CNNS IN THE RAIN
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Evaluation of self-driving cars using CNNs in the rain}

Once the best models were narrowed down to nvidia1 (\ref{app_res:49}) and nvidia2 (\ref{app_res:62}), a number of test runs were conducted to generate outputs for evaluation. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% OUTPUTS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Outputs}
Since this dissertation's topic first took shape (\ref{corr_with_super}) a number of outputs were generated, not all recorded or saved. With respect to outputs that were recorded and saved, this project generated five classes of outputs: 1. models, 2. videos, 3. tcpflow logs, 4. synthetic datasets and 5. code. A number of "Runs" were recorded in \ref{res:training_and_testing_log}. A run may or may not generate a model, may or may not generate a video and may or may not generate a tcpflow log. A model may be run several times, as were the best nvidia1 (\ref{app_res:49}) and nvidia2 (\ref{app_res:62}) models, tested with differente levels of rain and light intensity multipliers.
A compilation of saved models, videos and tcpflow logs, shown in \ref{app_res:outputs} lists 73 models, 61 published (YouTube) videos and 30 tcpflow logs. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% SYNTHETIC DATASETS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Synthetic datasets}
The data distribution depends on the track. Figure \ref{fig:GeneratedTrackPlusHist} shows a normalized histogram of 45410 steering angles obtained in 10 recorded sessions (data directory dataset/unity/smallLoop) corresponding to steering angles. The simulator records at a, computational resources allowing, maximum rate of 60 fps (frames per second). The observed average on the track was approximately 24 fps, representing in this case 31m32s  in approximately 19 laps. The 24 fps average was obtained by recording ("Auto Drive w Rec" option) for one lap, taking approximately 1m41s seconds and generating 2455 frames. The simulator registered fps rates higher than average on straight sections and lower than average on curved sections. This is assumed to be due to computational overheads imposed on the physics engine in the curved sections, resulting in less frames being recorded. The maximum steering angle, is set in the simulator with respect to a car. In this case it is plus or minutes 25 degrees. The normalized value, in the range of -1 to 1 is recorded. Values displayed in the histogram are multiplied by the maximum steering angle. The data shows a high bias towards right turns because the simulated vehicle drives clockwise around the track.
\begin{figure}[ht]

 \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/GeneratedTrackPlusHistogram.png}
 \caption{Normalized histogram of Unity 3D SDSandbox steering angles for 45410 image frames. The corresponding track (small\_looping\_couse) is shown on the right}
 \label{fig:GeneratedTrackPlusHist}
\end{figure}

Another simulated circuit used was the \textit{Generated Road}, which creates a random path on every run. This can be seen in figure \ref{fig:GeneratedRoadPlusHist}. The total number of frames collected for 15 \textit{Auto Drive w Rec} sessions (saved in dataset/unity/genRoad) was 280727, approximately 3h14m37s. The outliers, mainly to left of histogram, are due to the simulated vehicle being left unattended, reaching the end of the road and continuing into a section with no road markings, becoming stuck in a hard-left turn, until the simulation was switched off and recording halted. The mean and standard deviation, for angles in the range -20 to + 20, are -0.18 and 5.37 degrees respectively. The number of outliers omitted from the plot (not excluded from data at this stage) was 2204 (0.79\%). It can be seen that when more data points are collected, the bell-shaped curve becomes smoother.

\section{Network training and simulator testing}
\label{results:net-training} 
% write up, label runs and make reference
The first working model (able to successfully self-drive around the Generated Track) was   20201107210627\_nvidia1.h5. A video was generated using the recording screen utility Kazam (\cite{Kazam2020}), recording at 15fps (frames per second), and published at  \href{https://youtu.be/9z0mMtOnUUc}{https://youtu.be/9z0mMtOnUUc}. Figure \ref{fig:SimTCPPred}
shows 3 stills from the video containing from left to right, the game engine, the TCP debug output and the prediction engine running.

\label{fig:SimTCPPred}
\end{figure}

The video shows the TCP debugging, prediction engine and the game engine simulated car steering with predictions received over the TCP network. The actual code used to generate the model was not logged at the time the experiment log entry was written in the appendix log (\ref{AppendixD}). By verifying git hash commits (4 commits were made on November 7th) as documented in appendix  a second sanity check model \ref{app_res:36} (20201120171015\_ sanity.h5) was created and found to self-drive successfully around the generated track. A video was made from tcpflow frames as described at the end of \ref{app_res:36}, and uploaded to \href{https://youtu.be/JaSkkh-2xtI}{https://youtu.be/JaSkkh-2xtI}.
The video shows (fps discrepancies considered) that the \ref{app_res:36} model had a better lap around the track.
Model 37 (\ref{app_res:37}) trained with genRoad (including outliers seen in Figure \ref{fig:GeneratedRoadPlusHist}) ) did not do well. The oversteering can be seen in video \href{https://youtu.be/xGDN8qOnv9M}{https://youtu.be/xGDN8qOnv9M}. The steering angle bins and graph plots can be seen in  Figures \ref{fig:tcpflow_20201120184912_bins}  and \ref{fig:tcpflow_20201120184912_graph} in the results appendix.

Once the outliers were removed, another model was generated with five epochs of training to test if there was any difference in the loss values observed. The resulting model proved useful and was able to drive along the Generated Road course during a few seconds until the simulation was stopped. Below are the normalized histogram and bins recovered from tcplow logs for model

\section{Producing a self-driving model}

We added a video of the model running side by side with network as shown in figure

Starting with the NVIDIA baseline, a number of hyperparameters were trialed. The initial setup failed to generate usable models. 
The table below presents training results for best trained models.



Using the baseline neural network architecture as described in 
Models trained with no image pre-processing, did not perform well, leading to cars driving off the road, as shown in Fig.  sequence.

% data gathered on Robot Racing League track
We gathered 10 laps of data on the Robot Racing League track, with maximum speed set to 2.1, proportional control set to 16 and differential set to 77. Maximum steer was set to 25 (degrees). Corresponding to 12778 .jpg image files and the same number of  .json files, containing corresponding throttle and steering angle values recorded at the moment image was saved by simulator. This can be seen in the calls to Update() and SaveCamSensor functions in

\caption{Goodness-of-Steer $G_s$ results for best performing nvidia2 and nvidia1, plus "sanity" and nvidia\_ baseline for comparison, obtained from one lap of Generated Track and one stretch of Generated Road. Asterisks in \textit{gos} column indicate dry weather. Smiley face :) in Model column indicate best gos score. Sad face :( in Model column indicates worst $g_s$ scores. The logs used to generate the data used to compute the $g_s$ scores were generated with Unity intensity multiplier 1 and Skybox-Material set to Default-Skybox, the default sunny dry weather.}

\end{table}
Table \ref{table:goodness-of-steer} shows Goodness-of-Steer results for four networks and 2 SDSandbox track logs. The networks are the best performing nvidia2 (obtained in run 62 - \ref{app_res:62}), the second best performing nvidia1 (obtained in run 49 - \ref{app_res:49}), "sanity check" (obtained in run 36 - \ref{app_res:36}) and nvidia\_ baseline (obtained in run 68 - \ref{app_res:68}). Table data was generated with steerlib.py script. The track logs are for Generated Track (one lap) and Generated Road (on stretch). Rows 1, 2, 3 and 4 reflect plots "no rain", "light rain", "heavy rain slant +-10" and "torrential rain slant +-20" in Figure \ref{fig:sa_GeneratedTrackintensitymultiplier1_20201207192948_nvidia2} (with corresponding lap videos recorded from tcpflow log data in runs \ref{app_res:82}, \ref{app_res:83}, \ref{app_res:84} and  \ref{app_res:85}), where row ID 1 is the closest to ground truth plot. 

Figure \ref{fig:genTrackOneLap_logs_Wed_Nov_25_23_39_22_2020_ground_truth_steering_angles} shows the ground truth steering predictions as obtained in "Auto Drive w Rec" mode, for Generated Track, saved to log directory logs\_ Wed\_ Nov\_ 25\_ 23\_ 39\_ 22\_ 2020.

Bottom left is 20201207192948\_ nvidia2.h5 with no rain, bottom right 20201207192948\_ nvidia2.h5 light rain zero slant. Top left is 20201207091932\_ nvidia1.h5 light rain zero slant , top right is 20201207192948\_ nvidia2.h5 torrential rain -+20 degree slant.

Figure \ref{fig:20201207192948_nvidia2_mult_1_4_8_light} shows 3 stills taken for corresponding videos of network nvidia2 20201207192948\_ nvidia2.h5 (best performing model in the rain), for runs 83 (\ref{app_res:83}), 86 (\ref{app_res:86}) and 89 (\ref{app_res:89}), containing from left to right, the acquired image as produced by the Unity3D game engine (SDSandbox), the same image with added light rain and the processed image as presented to the network, which then predicts a steering angle. The first row for intensity multiply 1, the second for 4 and the third for 8. There are no lane markings in the last row, suggesting the network has learned about road boundaries and is able to generalise, given the image being presented (no lane markings) had never been seen before.

Figure \ref{fig:run-93-94-generated-road} shows a randomly Generated Road used for runs 93, 94 and 95, where the first few hundred frames go to near the top left of the circuit (long right 180 degree turn) shown in detail on the right hand image. The predicted steering angles shown in Figure  \ref{fig:20201207192948_nvidia2_dry_genRoad} for the well performing nvidia2 20201207192948\_ nvidia2.h5 model, show the majority of values in the positive range, as the simulated vehicle follows the road and takes a right turn to do so.

Figure \ref{fig:20201207192948_nvidia2_dry_genRoad_full} showing steering angles and normalized histogram plots. Run 95 (16m14s duration) was much longer than run 94 (1m11s duration) which seems also to be suggested in the distributions shown in the related histograms, as more data is present (about 800 data points in run 94 and 11000 data points in run 95), so is the distribution smoother.
