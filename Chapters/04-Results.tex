\label{Results} 

%This chapter presents the outputs that you produced, by applying the methods that you have selected, including e.g. analysis, design, prototyping, experimental work, evaluation, etc.  
  
%How you report these results will depend on the nature of the work. It may be helpful to divide them into basic data (e.g., for a project that developed a software product, requirements specification, test data, etc.) and analysis of the data (e.g. statistical analyses, evaluation analyses, etc.). Remember that you are informing the reader of what you have produced and found and emphasising the interesting parts, 
% IMPORTANT - ADD SUMMARIES
% so summarising at the end of each major section is useful.  
  
%It is usually very helpful for the readers to include graphics and diagrams, for instance to clarify software design or requirements, identify key trends and relationships in empirical data, etc. If you do so, be sure to refer to these figures in the text and use them as evidence to support what you are explaining or arguing; and be sure that your figures are well designed and clearly presented â€“ do not just use default settings of the software you are using in producing them.  
  
%It is essential that you identify clearly what you accomplished or produced yourself, as opposed to what existed before you started your individual project or was provided by others. For instance, some projects build new software on top of an existing code base, add new data to an existing body of data, or are executed by a student as a member of a team. It is essential to indicate what parts of the activities and results which you report are your own work. If this is left unclear, the markers are instructed not to give credit for work that they cannot attribute to you. Ambiguity would attract penalties for poor academic practice, with delays caused by any investigation (deception would be treated as academic misconduct, of course, which may lead to expulsion).

% Feedback from Artur Garcez with respect to Results
% The most important thing now is to describe clearly (with the right level of detail - not too much, not too little) the (...) evaluation of results (there's a more objective evaluation here of accuracy/speed but also a subjective evaluation that you can discuss in more detail: when a situation changes from "no rain" to "rain" and how that affects the pre-trained network). With those results you will have the material needed for the important discussion chapter which should include your own critical evaluation of results and also point to future work.

% \section{Synthetic datasets}

\subsection{Generated Track}
Figure \ref{fig:GeneratedTrackPlusHist} shows a normalized histogram of 45410 steering angles obtained in 10 recorded sessions (data directory dataset/unity/smallLoop) for the small\_ looping\_ circuit track seen on the right. The circuit is the same as the Generated Track circuit, while the landscape in the latter excludes trees, bushes and tall grass. The simulator records at a, computational resources allowing, maximum rate of 60 fps (frames per second). The observed average on the track was approximately 24 fps, representing in this case 31m32s of recorded data in approximately 19 laps. The 24 fps average was obtained by recording ("Auto Drive w Rec" option) for one lap, taking approximately 1m41s seconds and generating 2455 frames. The simulator registered fps rates higher than average on straight sections and lower than average on curved sections. This is assumed to be due to computational overheads imposed on the physics engine in the curved sections, resulting in less frames being processed and recorded. The maximum steering angle is set in the simulator with respect to a car. In this case it is plus or minus 25 degrees. The normalized value, in the range of -1 to 1 is recorded. Values displayed in the histogram are multiplied by the maximum steering angle, referred to in this study as the \textit{normalization constant}. The data shows a high bias towards positive steering angles because the simulated vehicle drives clockwise around the track. From the starting line on the top left, there are two right turns, followed by a left turn, followed by two right turns.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:genTrackOneLap_logs_Wed_Nov_25_23_39_22_2020_ground_truth_steering_angles} shows the \textit{ground truth} (not predicted) steering angles obtained in "Auto Drive w Rec" mode, for one lap driven around the Generated Track, saved to log directory dataset / Unity / genTrack / logs\_ Wed\_ Nov\_ 25\_ 23\_ 39\_ 22\_ 2020 made available for download in \ref{res:download-links}. The y axis is inverted such that plot follows steering adjustments, if observer tilts head to the right. The four troughs  represent the four right turns. The hump between frames 500 and 700 represents the only (gentle) left turn in the circuit, where the steering angle is keep negative while the vehicle negotiates the bend.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Generated Road}
Another simulated circuit used was the \textit{Generated Road}, which creates a random path on every run. This can be seen in figure \ref{fig:GeneratedRoadPlusHist}. The total number of frames collected for 15 \textit{Auto Drive w Rec} sessions (saved in dataset/unity/genRoad) was 280727, approximately 3h14m37s. The outliers, mainly to left of histogram, are due to the simulated vehicle being left unattended, reaching the end of the road and continuing into a section with no road markings, becoming stuck in a hard-left turn, until the simulation was switched off and recording halted. The mean and standard deviation, for angles in the range -20 to + 20 (excludes outliers), are -0.18 and 5.37 degrees respectively. The number of outliers omitted from the plot (not excluded from data at this stage) was 2204 (0.79\%). It can be seen that when more data points are collected, the histogram becomes "smoother", if compared to equivalent plot in Figure  \ref{fig:GeneratedTrackPlusHist}.
Both boths are clearly centered around zero degrees, meaning the vehicle is driving straight more often than not. The Generated Road has a normally distributed steering angle distribution because of the same number of left and right turns in the circuit, which infers the data distribution is track-dependant.

\end{figure}

\section{Training self-driving models}
Model training was performed using a modified version of the SDSandbox/src/train.py script. A successful training run produces four files: a plain text .log file containing the script running time duration and last recorded values of accuracy and loss for training and validation (the training "history"), a .history file in the pickle format containing all history values, a model .h5 file in the pickle format containing the model structure and weights, and a .png image file containing a history plot for the training run.
Figure \ref{fig:devcloud_nvidia2__camber_baseline_local_sanity_accuracy} shows three training history plots: 20201124032017\_ nvidia2.h5 trained for 23 epochs on the Intel DevCloud, 20201121090912\_ nvidia\_ baseline.h5 trained for 2 epochs on Camber and 20201120184912\_ sanity.h5 trained for 82 epochs on the local workstation. The left y axis represents loss and the right y axis represents accuracy values. The x axis represents training epochs (one run through the entire dataset). The title for each plot contains the last recorded training history values and the model name.
\begin{figure}[ht]

 \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/devcloud_nvidia2__camber_baseline_local_sanity_accuracy.png}

 \label{fig:devcloud_nvidia2__camber_baseline_local_sanity_accuracy}
\end{figure}

Listing \ref{training_logs} shows the corresponding log files for each run, training run documented in \ref{app_res:62} (devcloud), \ref{app_res:98} (camber) and \ref{app_res:37} (local) respectively.

Training and validation data was split at 80\%/20\% ratio. Early stopping was used with patience typically set to 6 epochs for validation loss (stop if no decrease over 5 epochs). Images were presented to network in batches of 64. The Adam optimizer was used with a learning rate of 0.0001 and mean squared error loss function. Trainnig and testing runs are documented in appendix \ref{AppendixD}.

% Testing self-driving models without rain
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Testing self-driving models without rain}
To create a proof-of-concept, the initial model architecture used was TawnNet. In the documentation, the author states that with the SDSandbox framework, self-driving was achieved with a few hours of recorded laps and up to one day (24 hours) training time on GPU, with the code supplied "as is". This experiment was replicated (20.07.2020 on CPU) while the outcome was not as the car, after initially staying on the Generated Road, drove off the track. The experiment recorded in video  \url{https://youtu.be/453mTlL2gvs}.    

The first working model (able to successfully self-drive around the Generated Track) was the 20201107210627\_ nvidia1.h5, with the nvidia1 (TawnNet) model on 07.11.2020. A video was generated using the recording screen utility Kazam (\cite{Kazam2020}), recording at 15fps (frames per second), and published at  \url{https://youtu.be/9z0mMtOnUUc}. Figure \ref{fig:SimTCPPred}
shows 3 stills from the video containing from left to right, the game engine, the tcpflow TCP debug output and the prediction engine running. tcpflow was added to the process in this project as a debugging tool, and does not exist in the original SDSandbox.

\begin{figure}[h!]

\caption{Stills of video \url{https://youtu.be/9z0mMtOnUUc} showing left to right: SDSandbox simulated car going around the Generated Track course, TCP Debug (tcpflow) and prediction engine (predict\_ client.py) running}
\label{fig:SimTCPPred}
\end{figure}

A record of what code generated the successfull model was not made at the time. Forensics in \ref{app_res:36} using git logs and further tests conducted in \ref{app_res:37}, \ref{app_res:38}, \ref{app_res:39} ("sanity" models) determined it was achieved by porting the data augmentation and pre-processing described in \ref{met:data-aug-pre-proc} to the SDSandbox training and prediction scripts. The augmentation is applied during training, with a probability of 0.6, pre-processing is applied to all images. Pre-processing is applied to all images received from simulator during inference time.

Once the sanity model could successfully drive around the Generated Track, tcpflow logs were captured and used to generate the video shown in Figure \ref{fig:20201120171015_sanity_sim_network}. A script was written for this end (MakeVideo.py) and the actual running of the script documented in \ref{app_res:41}. The video in this case is obtained by processing all still images logged by tcpflow, as when they were sent from the simulator to the prediction engine during inference time. In MakeVideo.py, the adapted \cite{Naoki2016} augmentation library is used to pre-process the original image such that it will be the same as the image presented to the network. The predicted angle is obtained from tcpflow. Labels added to the images, then both images (original and processed) are concatenated horizontally and added to a video one frame at a time using the opencv-python module. The ratio for each individual frame in the composition is set to 800x600 pixels.
\begin{figure}[ht]

 \label{fig:20201120171015_sanity_sim_network} 
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:sa_GeneratedTrack_20201120171015_sanity} shows the plot for \textbf{predicted} steering angles around Generated Track for run 41, whereas in Figure \ref{fig:genTrackOneLap_logs_Wed_Nov_25_23_39_22_2020_ground_truth_steering_angles} shows \textbf{ground truth} steering angles are plotted. The predictions start at around 5 degrees steering slowly edging close to zero degrees. This can be observed on the video as the car moves closer to the left edge of the lane (positive steering), then continues straight.
The plot for predicted angles seems smoother than for ground truth angles. This may be due to the PID settings where the response to going off the desired path is more abrupt, and "jerkier", in trying to correct itself.

 \label{fig:sa_GeneratedTrack_20201120171015_sanity} 
\end{figure}

At this stage, the nvidia1 model was proven to self-drive. The nvidia2 and nvidia\_ baseline models required more work. The first step was to "clean" the genRoad dataset. % Fixing the data
Figure \ref{fig:SkewCleanup} shows from left to right, an overlay of all plots of normalized histogram plots for steering values contained in unity/genRoad directory, the folder containing most outliers (logs\_Thu\_Jul\_ \_9\_16\_00\_15\_2020) and the resulting plot once the outliers' folder was removed from unity/genRoad. 
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/SkewCleanup.png}
\caption{Left to right, normalized histograms of all genRoad folders, outlier's folder and all data with outliers removed.}
\label{fig:SkewCleanup}
\end{figure}
The presence of outliers is believed to have caused issues with the nvidia\_ baseline model from runs \ref{app_res:15} to \ref{app_res:31}. The next issue was found to be the ratio used to crop images presented to both "problematic" networks. Run 55 (\ref{app_res:55}) provides analisys. Figure \ref{fig:nvidia1x1_nvidia2x3_crops_results} shows on the left, the crop (pre-processed image) presented to nvidia1 and sanity models. The actual crop values were determined by the imported augmentation library, which had crop values set to "frame" the "part of interest" in images (320x160) generated by the Udacity sim. The crop turned out to work for the nvidia1 and sanity models with images (160x120) generated by the SDSandbox sim, which is a \textit{fluke}, by removing 60 pixels from the top and 25 pixels from the bottom of SDSandbox images, the result was an image that seems to best frame the road. The issue was corrected by using the third crop, from left to right and a working nvidia2 model was generated in run 62 (\ref{app_res:62}). Crop values are set in script conf.py, adapted for this project.

\end{figure}



Figure \ref{fig:run-93-94-generated-road} shows a randomly Generated Road used for runs 93, 94 and 95, where the first few hundred frames go to near the top left of the circuit (long right 180 degree turn) shown in detail on the right hand image. The predicted steering angles shown in Figure  \ref{fig:20201207192948_nvidia2_dry_genRoad} for the well performing nvidia2 20201207192948\_ nvidia2.h5 model, show the majority of values in the positive range, as the simulated vehicle follows the road and takes a right turn to do so.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:20201207192948_nvidia2_dry_genRoad_full} showing steering angles and normalized histogram plots. Run 95 (16m14s duration) was much longer than run 94 (1m11s duration) which seems also to be suggested in the distributions shown in the related histograms, as more data is present (about 800 data points in run 94 and 11000 data points in run 95), so is the distribution smoother.

% ADDING RAIN
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Adding rain}
\label{res:adding-rain-section}
Using the Automould library, scrip predict\_ client.py was modified for rain to be added in real time for predictions. Two schemes were considered. The first where rain is added directly to the network image, as show in Figure \ref{fig:tcpflow_Run43}. Although the procedure introduces noise to images, it is somewhat unrealistic, as rain is expected to be present on the acquired image.
\begin{figure}[ht]
 \centering 
 \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/tcpflow_Run43.png}
 \caption{Video still showing left to right, the acquired image supplied by the simulator, a processed network image with no rain and the same image with torrential rain added. This last being the image presented to the network. A video was recorded in run \ref{app_res:43}, \url{https://youtu.be/57jwwcjbfdE}, showing the model driving off the track.}
 \label{fig:tcpflow_Run43} 
\end{figure}
The second scheme, which was adopted for this project, was to add rain to the acquired image, this is shown in Figures  \ref{fig:youtube20201207091932nvidia1lightrainmult_4_h5},
\ref{fig:youtube20201207091932nvidia1heavy10mult_4_h5}, and

\end{table}

Table \ref{table:goodness-of-steer} shows Goodness-of-Steer results for four networks and 2 SDSandbox track logs, that is, the results were generated by running predictions on synthetic datasets, which contain ground truth steering values, like shown in Figure \ref{fig:genTrackOneLap_logs_Wed_Nov_25_23_39_22_2020_ground_truth_steering_angles}. 

The networks are the best performing nvidia2 (obtained in run 62 - \ref{app_res:62}), the second best performing nvidia1 (obtained in run 49 - \ref{app_res:49}), "sanity check" (obtained in run 36 - \ref{app_res:36}) and nvidia\_ baseline (obtained in run 68 - \ref{app_res:68}). Table data was generated with steerlib.py script. The track logs are for Generated Track (one lap) and Generated Road (one stretch). There are 32 rows, each sequence of four (1-4, 5-8 and so on) representing one model subject to sunny weather followed by 3 types of rain. 

Rows 1, 2, 3 and 4 reflect plots "no rain", "light rain", "heavy rain slant +-10" and "torrential rain slant +-20" in Figure \ref{fig:sa_GeneratedTrackintensitymultiplier1_20201207192948_nvidia2} (with corresponding lap videos recorded from tcpflow log data in runs \ref{app_res:82}, \ref{app_res:83}, \ref{app_res:84} and  \ref{app_res:85}), where row ID 1 is the closest to ground truth plot. 




Once the best models were narrowed down to nvidia1 (\ref{app_res:49}) and nvidia2 (\ref{app_res:62}), a number of test runs were conducted to generate outputs for evaluation.

\section{Modifications to original source codes}
Modifications were required to original source codes that were integrated in this project: \cite{Saxena2017} (Automold), \cite{Naoki2016} (Augmentation), and \cite{SDSandboxSim} (SDSandbox). The automold library is designed to process lists of RGB images represented as numpy (\cite{harris2020array}) arrays. Function \textit{add\_ rain\_ single} was added to Automold.py script to deal with image arrays being processed one at a time when running predictions with added rain in real time. The Augmentation library was incorporated into a python class in Augmentation.py. The original code was modified such that before beginning augmentation, the image is resized to the expected acquired size as produced by camera (e.g. 320x160 for nvidia2 and nvidia\_ baseline models, 160x120 for nvidia1 and sanity models). This was set as a configuration parameter in the SDSandbox script conf.py. The preprocessing was modified to use top and bottom crop sizes from configurable values set in conf.py.  
 
The modifications to SDSandbox were made to scripts conf.py, predict\_ client.py and train.py. conf.py was modified such that parameters could be set then shared across function calls. For instance, when running script predict\_ client.py in \ref{app_res:83}, conf.py is used to store rain, slant and record arguments in configuration settings, further checked throughout the running script to determine actions. Image geometry parameters image width, height, depth, expected network width and height, top and bottom crop values for preprocessing was stored as python lists in conf.py. This ensured that the same image geometry was being used during training and inference time for the specified network. This is set with command line argument --modelname for inference in predict\_ client.py (e.g. \ref{app_res:83}) and --model in train.py (e.g. \ref{app_res:92}) for training.  
predict\_ client.py was modified to use the Augmentation class, the modified conf.py and the Automold library, to preprocess image with correct geometry, before presenting to network for prediction, and to add rain to images. The script was also modified to generate videos making use of the RecordVideo.py class.  
train.py was modified to take additional command line arguments --aug and --preproc to determine if augmentation and preprocessing were to be performed for testing. The script was also modified to save: the training history, a history training image and a training log file. Network image geometries settings in conf.py are also used by train.py in the modified version.

The first row for intensity multiply 1, the second for 4 and the third for 8. There are no lane markings in the last row, suggesting the network has learned about road boundaries and is able to generalise, given the image being presented (no lane markings) had never been seen before.

\section{Outputs}
Since this dissertation's topic first took shape (\ref{corr_with_super}) a number of outputs were generated, not all recorded or saved. With respect to outputs that were recorded and saved, this project generated five classes of outputs: 1. models, 2. videos, 3. tcpflow logs, 4. synthetic datasets and 5. code. A number of "Runs" were recorded in \ref{res:training_and_testing_log}. A run may or may not generate a model, may or may not generate a video and may or may not generate a tcpflow log. A model may be run several times, as were the best nvidia1 (\ref{app_res:49}) and nvidia2 (\ref{app_res:62}) models, tested with differente levels of rain and light intensity multipliers.
A compilation of saved models, videos and tcpflow logs, shown in \ref{app_res:outputs} lists 73 models, 61 published (YouTube) videos and 30 tcpflow logs at the time of compilation.

\section{Locating rainy sections with Mechanical Turk}
\label{res:mech-turk}
To investigate the effect of rain in self-driving CNNs in a real world dataset, an attempt was made to locate such images in available autonomous vehicle public datasets.
The data that looked most promising was Ford V2 Log 1 and V3 Log 1 from the FordAV dataset (\cite{agarwal2020ford}), both described as "freeway, overpass, bridge, cloudy". The goal was the set to label a sample of the cloudy images with Amazon Mechanical Turk and 50 images were uniformly drawn from each log, plus 5 images with rain added with the Automold library using the RainyImagesDissertationPlot.ipynb script. The expectation being the 5 extra images be labelled as "Rain". The 105 images were then added to a SageMaker Ground Truth job. The platform works as a wrapper around Mechanical Turk as it facilitates the creation of user interfaces (Figure \ref{fig:MechTurkCreateJob})

\caption{The SageMaker Ground Truth user interface template with two labels ("Rain", "No Rain"), the image to be labeled and examples of correct and incorrect classifications. On the top left are images supplied as "Good example" of rain. The lower of the two being an image modified with the Automold library to add rain. After the job was submitter, the image was labelled by a Mechanical Turk worker as "No Rain".}
\label{fig:MechTurkCreateJob}
\end{figure}
Labelling tasks are classified as low, medium and high complexity. The prices range from \$0.012 for a low complexity task, with a 5 second estimate to complete, to \$1.20 for a high complexity task with a 3.5 minute estimate to complete.
The task can be configured with an output for time taken by a worker on a single task, the lowest time interval being one minute.
There is also an option to assign more than one worker per dataset object, on account that it can help increase the accuracy of the data labels.
The task was created with the most basic options of one worker, a \$0.012 price per task, a one minute timeout and remained live for 12 hours. 
The images were labelled by one Mechanical Turk worker and results made available in a json encoded file (dataset/mechanical-turk/2020-11-21\_22 45 37.json). In case more than one worker is assigned to a same task, a confidence score is also provided in the results. Results showed no images had been labeled as "Rain". The assumption then being there are no sections containing rain in the dataset. The Automold library added rain images were also labeled as "No Rain" by the worker. Figure \ref{fig:MechTurkLabeledImages} shows one page of the SageMaker Ground Truth completed job, detailing 4 labelled images on the Labeling Job Summary page. A side-effect of the labelling job being Automold rain where not seen by a human as such. The implication is further discussed in \ref{Discussion}.
