Convolutional Neural Networks are currently state-of-the-art in supervised image classification tasks, used in both \textit{pipelined} (TODO: find better definition) and \textit{end-to-end} architectures, the former relying on a fusion of image and sensor data the latter on images alone, to determine steering and movement output.  
However, CNNs have been shown to lack robustness when given noisy images, in some cases a single pixel change is known to output labels that for humans would have been obviously the same as the denoised version.
As deep learning models, be it CNNs, RNNs or Deep RL rely increasingly on image to solve computer vision for robotics problems in general, and for self-driving cars in particular, it is important to evaluate the effect of random noise on images used by such models.
As many manufacturers have expressed interest in developing self-driving cars, it is important to gauge the effect of noise such as rain on the performance of the self-driving models.
