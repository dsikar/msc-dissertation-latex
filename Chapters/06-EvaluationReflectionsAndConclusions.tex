\label{Eval} 

This chapter should evaluate the project work as a whole. Here the original choice of objectives, the literature examined, the methods used, the planning, etc. are all reviewed to see what has been achieved by undertaking the project. There may be a summary of general conclusions drawn from the work done, highlighting the particular contribution of your project. You should also consider the implications of these conclusions. Discuss any proposals that you might make for further work, having discovered what you now know. It is also important to include a reflective section covering what you have learned from the project process. What would you do differently if you were to start again, knowing what you now know? Your report MUST include adequate Evaluation, Reflections and Conclusions to gain a passing grade.  

Here would be a good place, perhaps, to discuss "Understanding deep learning requires rethinking generalization", Zhang ICLR 2017, on deep models fitting random data (noise) perfectly.

The absence of good quality labelled datasets has been cited (TODO citation needed) as a hindrance to the development of good models (TODO need to insert in CONTEXT section "the term model hereafter, refers to a either a neural network architeture, or a trained model capable of making predictions given an input). It is ironic that the availability of good quality labelled models, such as Imagenet, led to the improvement in image classification models, which in turn may curb the need to use Mechanical Turk. This could perhaps form part of the wider discussion on automated workforce replacing human workforce and the social implications therein.
