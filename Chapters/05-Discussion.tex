\label{Discussion} 

%This chapter examines your results in comparison with your objectives, and then in the wider perspective of other theoretical and applied work relevant to your project, as covered in your review in Chapter 2. For instance, for a software product you will discuss how well it satisfies the user needs that it addresses, its performance and dependability, aspects of design, implementation or assessment that have proved good choices or that instead you would change if you were to repeat the project knowing what you now know. For novel research results or any other knowledge obtained through the project, you will discuss your confidence in the results, their validity, scope and their generalisability. What are the implications of what you have found out? Do you have any recommendations as a result?

%Another interesting performance metric, "While ResNets have definitely improved over Oxfordâ€™s VGG models in terms of efficiency, GoogleNet seems to still be more efficient in terms of the accuracy / ms ratio.", basically how much accuracy is achieved with respect to training time, this could provide a single magnitude.
