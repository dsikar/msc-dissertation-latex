\chapter{Methods}

\label{Methods} 

This chapter describes in detail the methods for whatever activities were necessary for your project – e.g., data gathering, data analysis, requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing/evaluation, etc. Your choice of methods should be discussed and justified in view of the project objectives, and with reference to the pertinent literature. Report not only what methods you applied in generic terms, but what you actually did: sufficient information about dates and details for your reader to understand how you ran your project, rather than just how one could run any similar project.  

Report in this chapter what you did, not what you produced or found as a 
result (which goes under Results).  
  
Note: only use the word ‘methodology’ if you know what it means!
