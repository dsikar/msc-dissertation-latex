TITLE = {Self-Driving Car Location Estimation Based on a Particle-Aided Unscented Kalman Filter},
JOURNAL = {Sensors},

ABSTRACT = {Localization is one of the key components in the operation of self-driving cars. Owing to the noisy global positioning system (GPS) signal and multipath routing in urban environments, a novel, practical approach is needed. In this study, a sensor fusion approach for self-driving cars was developed. To localize the vehicle position, we propose a particle-aided unscented Kalman filter (PAUKF) algorithm. The unscented Kalman filter updates the vehicle state, which includes the vehicle motion model and non-Gaussian noise affection. The particle filter provides additional updated position measurement information based on an onboard sensor and a high definition (HD) map. The simulations showed that our method achieves better precision and comparable stability in localization performance compared to previous approaches.},

%% Safety, liability, privacy, cybersecurity issues related to autonomous vehicles
% AVs rely on artificial intelligence
% (AI), sensors and big data to analyse information, adapt to changing circumstances and
%handle complex situations as a substitute for human %judgement, as the latter would no
%longer be needed for conventional vehicle operations %such as lane-changing, parking, collision avoidance %and braking (Long, Hanford, Janrathitikarn, Sinsley, & %Miller, 2007; West,
%2016).1 This perceived superiority to human drivers is %attributed to high-performance computing that allows %AVs to process, learn from and adjust their guidance %systems according
%to changes in external conditions at much faster rates %than the typical human driver, and it
%is supplemented with vehicle-to-vehicle (V2 V) and %vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, %allowing AVs to learn from other vehicles (West, %2016).

abstract= {Course Description
Computer Vision has become ubiquitous in our society, with applications in search, image understanding, apps, mapping, medicine, drones, and self-driving cars. Core to many of these applications are visual recognition tasks such as image classification, localization and detection. Recent developments in neural network (aka “deep learning”) approaches have greatly advanced the performance of these state-of-the-art visual recognition systems. This course is a deep dive into details of the deep learning architectures with a focus on learning end-to-end models for these tasks, particularly image classification. During the 10-week course, students will learn to implement, train and debug their own neural networks and gain a detailed understanding of cutting-edge research in computer vision. The final assignment will involve training a multi-million parameter convolutional neural network and applying it on the largest image classification dataset (ImageNet). We will focus on teaching how to set up the problem of image recognition, the learning algorithms (e.g. backpropagation), practical engineering tricks for training and fine-tuning the networks and guide the students through hands-on assignments and a final course project. Much of the background and materials of this course will be drawn from the ImageNet Challenge.},
