TITLE = {Self-Driving Car Location Estimation Based on a Particle-Aided Unscented Kalman Filter},
JOURNAL = {Sensors},
VOLUME = {20},

ABSTRACT = {Localization is one of the key components in the operation of self-driving cars. Owing to the noisy global positioning system (GPS) signal and multipath routing in urban environments, a novel, practical approach is needed. In this study, a sensor fusion approach for self-driving cars was developed. To localize the vehicle position, we propose a particle-aided unscented Kalman filter (PAUKF) algorithm. The unscented Kalman filter updates the vehicle state, which includes the vehicle motion model and non-Gaussian noise affection. The particle filter provides additional updated position measurement information based on an onboard sensor and a high definition (HD) map. The simulations showed that our method achieves better precision and comparable stability in localization performance compared to previous approaches.},

%% Safety, liability, privacy, cybersecurity issues related to autonomous vehicles
% AVs rely on artificial intelligence
% (AI), sensors and big data to analyse information, adapt to changing circumstances and
%handle complex situations as a substitute for human %judgement, as the latter would no
%longer be needed for conventional vehicle operations %such as lane-changing, parking, collision avoidance %and braking (Long, Hanford, Janrathitikarn, Sinsley, & %Miller, 2007; West,
%2016).1 This perceived superiority to human drivers is %attributed to high-performance computing that allows %AVs to process, learn from and adjust their guidance %systems according
%to changes in external conditions at much faster rates %than the typical human driver, and it
%is supplemented with vehicle-to-vehicle (V2 V) and %vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, %allowing AVs to learn from other vehicles (West, %2016).
