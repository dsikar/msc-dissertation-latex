Reread the MSc Project Guidance Document (https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=1484635) and a project report given as sample reference (Minah 2015 - https://moodle.city.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=1484742)

Examined audi dataset preview from https://www.a2d2.audi/a2d2/en/download.html trying to work out how to map images to steering angles. Have been in touch with Dr. Mahmud, on the the authors of Audi papers with respect to aforementioned mapping.

Managed ok. Timestamp is in TIA format. For every .png image there is a corresponding .json file with image timestamp information. All steering angles are provided in a single file containing bus signals, such that the reading taken at the time nearest to a given image may be considered the desired steering angle. A few random images were examined, consisting of urban scenes and not adequate as the vehicle is driving through a city circuit, where no inferences are made about vision, road geometry and steering.

Downloading Ford Dataset - need to unpack and look at rosbag data to infer steering angles (algorithm to be written). 
Amazon mechanical turk taps into this data, to find rainy sections.

Structuring report Introduction and Objective based on Chammas 2019, using wordcounts and reference counts as a base.

We need to make a start asap on the Unity testing circuits (x3), that will effectively generate our data. We also need to make a start asap on the NVIDIA vanilla model, be it in PyTorch or Keras/Tensorflow, and get training and testing this model while we develop the alternative models.

Good-to-have would be an AWS training/testing instance, depending on costs.

Replied to email from supervisor, suggesting a write-up be made of preliminary results, which may be re-used in report (thesis). I'll aim to get that over by end of August. A lot to do i.e. create tracks, create models generate data (see next entry).

Watched Tawn Kramer's intro video to Unity x Tensorflow self driving setup. Model trained on 100 GB of data - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0AFMilaeMI

Flow chart, diagram generating software. I am looking, considering Gimp, Inkscape. Also found Dia, which looks promissing.

** Ran on both camber and devcloud:

To generate models.

1. clone git repo:

$ git clone https://github.com/dsikar/sdsandbox.git

2. Copy data

$ scp devcloud:~/git/sdsandbox/dataset/autogen_track.tar.gz

3. Unpack data to ~/git/sdsandbox/dataset/log

4. Change directory to src and run

$ python train.py --model=../outputs/camber_model_4.h5

Notes:

Camber fails with error "Error occurred when finalizing GeneratorDataset iterator: Cancelled: Operation was cancelled"

** Our main task w.r.t. models is adapt additional models (i.e. in addition to NVIDIA model) to become regression models, as the non-NVIDIA architectures are defined as classification models where the last layer will tipically be a 1000-way output (with softmax?) drawing the "winner" from a distribution (discuss).

We found this article lathuilire2018comprehensive (added to dissertation.bib) with a discussion about deep regression models.

** Still ruminating over GoogleLeNet article. Pressing issue now is get models trained and tested on basic setup, i.e., Unity 3D generated images and steering angles. we have a head start in Tawn Kraemer's code (train.py) and other implementations.  

The link trail:

One Udacity alumni:
https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-for-self-driving-cars-7f198ef4cfa2
did a good write-up, reported problems and cites this repo as the salvation:
https://github.com/hminle/car-behavioral-cloning-with-pytorch/
who in turn was inspired by this repo:
https://github.com/naokishibuya/car-behavioral-cloning
Naoki did a good write-up here:
https://medium.com/@naokishibuya/introduction-to-udacity-self-driving-car-simulator-4d78198d301d

Tasks (one of two, better the two, but at least one):
1. Get the unity 3D data we have to work with naoki's model - medium difficulty
2. Get Naoki's model to work with Tawn's setup - better but potentially hard, as a large library needs to travel across.
https://github.com/tawnkramer/sdsandbox
Let's start with 1. ... 21:26...

We need to check if image sizes are compatible, or what kind of adjustment needs to be made...

Later, need to assess what is the minimum steering angle required, and the quantisation, i.e. precision. Currently angle tipically is 0.09035701304674149

Tawn Kraemer angle in radians	Angle in degrees
0.09035701304674149		5.1770754969996453099

If we use 0.09, we get 5.15662, which is pretty dawn close.
If we use 0.1, we get 5.72958. Which is not ideal but gives
us an idea of what we could do with binning these values.

We will need to look at angle values as a whole, to decide. 
The hypothesis is that angles will not vary a hell of a lot.

Naoki's model seems to spend most of the time between +- 2 degrees.
going as far as +-8 degrees, with two decimal placess, so about 1600
discrete values, though that could probably be reduced a lot, if say
we allow changes in 1/3 of a degree, that would be 48 values total,
with the majority around 12 values (4 * 3 ~ +- 2).

So basically we would be looking at converting and truncating, i.e.
convert 0.09035701304674149 to 5.1770754969996453099 and
truncate 5.17, or round, TBD.

And jumping ahead, here is a tutorial on adding rain to Unity 3D through "particles"

Another good one, maybe better - simpler, parts 1 and 2

We looked at Andrew Ng's videos on ConvNets and also read and annotated the GoogleLeNet (Inception) paper. 

We now have under 3 months to deliver first draft and under 4 months to deliver dissertation. We need to start thinking about downsizing project if we do not get some results by the end of this month, e.g. one or two nets only, no evaluation on circuit, just on steering angles.

01.09.2020

We looked at the VGG paper and wrote some notes.
